# Advanced Data Analysis of a Music App With Python

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python for advanced data analysis, showcasing techniques that extend beyond the capabilities of traditional analytics platforms like Mixpanel. The analysis was conducted on a synthetic dataset created specifically for this project, containing over 140,000 rows of simulated user interaction data. The goal was to illustrate how Python can be leveraged for in-depth analysis, predictive modeling, and deriving actionable insights.
## Dataset

### Synthetic Data Creation
- The dataset was generated from scratch to simulate realistic user interactions within a music streaming or content platform. It includes features such as:
  - `Artist`
  - `Song`
  - `Event Type` (e.g., Played, Liked, Shared)
  - `Playlist Name`
  - `Search Query`
  - `Timestamp`
  
- **Size**: Over 140,000 rows.
- **Purpose**: The data was designed to allow for comprehensive analysis, including trend analysis, predictive modeling, and user segmentation.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Data**: Managed missing values and inconsistencies within the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features such as artist popularity levels and one-hot encoded categorical variables to enrich the dataset.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations
- **Visualizations**: Generated various plots to explore the distribution of event types, artist popularity, and user engagement patterns.
- **Insights**: Analyzed top artists, playlists, and search queries to identify trends within the data.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- **Models Used**: Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
- **Objective**: Predict artist popularity based on user interaction data.
- **Results**: Achieved up to 90% accuracy in predicting artist popularity, showcasing Python's strength in advanced predictive analytics.

### 4. Feature Importance Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify key features that influence artist popularity.
- **Results**: Determined the most impactful features, such as playlist names and search queries, providing actionable insights for content strategy.

### 5. Clustering Analysis
- **Objective**: Segment users based on engagement patterns.
- **Results**: Identified distinct user clusters, enabling targeted strategies for content delivery and user retention.

## Key Insights

- **Advanced Analytics Beyond Mixpanel**: While Mixpanel is useful for basic analytics, Python offers the flexibility to perform custom modeling, deep dives into data, and detailed visualizations that provide a deeper understanding of user behavior.
- **Scalability**: Python's ability to handle large datasets and perform complex analyses makes it a valuable tool for any data-driven strategy.
